# Analysis of Students' Perceptions of AI in Education

This repository contains the MATLAB code and dataset for a course project analyzing students' perceptions of Artificial Intelligence in education. The analysis is based on a public dataset from Kaggle and explores students' attitudes, knowledge, and feelings towards the integration of AI in the learning process.

## About the Project

This project was developed as a final assignment for a MATLAB programming course. The primary goal is to demonstrate data processing, analysis, and visualization capabilities using MATLAB. The script processes raw survey data, performs statistical analysis, and generates a series of plots to illustrate key findings.

The analysis focuses on:
-   Demographic distribution of the respondents.
-   Students' self-assessed knowledge of AI and their primary sources of information.
-   Correlations between students' knowledge, their perception of AI's utility, and their academic performance (GPA).
-   Key perceived advantages and disadvantages of using AI in teaching, learning, and evaluation.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this analysis is **"Students' Perceptions of AI in Education"** by Marvel Teodorescu, available on Kaggle.

-   **Source:** [Kaggle Dataset Link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gianinamariapetrascu/survey-on-students-perceptions-of-ai-in-education/data)
-   **File:** `ai_in_edu_dataset.csv` (included in this repository for reproducibility).

The dataset contains survey responses from 91 undergraduate students from the Faculty of Cybernetics, Statistics, and Economic Informatics.

## Requirements

To run the analysis script, you will need:
-   **MATLAB** (tested on version R2024b and later)
-   **Statistics and Machine Learning Toolboxâ„¢**

## How to Use

1.  Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2.  Ensure both files (`ai_edu_research.m` and `ai_in_edu_dataset.csv`) are in the same directory.
3.  Open `ai_edu_research.m` in MATLAB.
4.  Run the script by clicking the **Run** button or by typing `ai_edu_research` in the MATLAB Command Window.

The script will execute the full analysis and generate six figures, each visualizing a different aspect of the data. A confirmation message will be displayed in the Command Window upon successful completion.
